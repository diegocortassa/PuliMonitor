PuliMonitor Public License
Version 1.0, February 9, 2015

PuliMonitor license is the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) version 3, with some exclusions regarding "derived work" definition, see below. Put simply, it’s a less restrictive version of LGPL.

Under the LGPL you may use PuliMonitor for any purpose you wish, and modify it if you require, as long as you:
   1. Pass on the (modified) PuliMonitor source code with your software, with original copyrights intact.
         a. If you distribute electronically, the source can be a separate download (either from your own site if you modified PuliMonitor, or to the PuliMonitor site if you used an unmodified version) - just include a link in your documentation.
         b. If you distribute physical media, the PuliMonitor source code that you used to build your application should be included on that media.
   2. Make it clear where you have customised it.

In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exclusions and clarifications to the LGPL conditions apply to PuliMonitor:
   1. Making modifications to PuliMonitor configuration files, build scripts and configuration headers in order to create a customised build setup of PuliMonitor with the otherwise unmodified source code, does not constitute a derived work.
   2. Building against PuliMonitor headers which have inlined code does not constitute a derived work.
   3. Code which inherits PuliMonitor classes outside of the PuliMonitor libraries does not form a derived work.
   4. Statically linking the PuliMonitor libraries into a user application does not make the user application a derived work.

As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to distribute source code for, so when the clauses above define something as not a derived work, it means you don’t have to distribute source code for it. However, the original PuliMonitor source code with all modifications must always be made available.
